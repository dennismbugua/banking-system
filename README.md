# Banking System Setup Tutorial 🏦

## 📋 What You'll Need

Before we begin, make sure you have these installed on your computer:

- **Python 3.8+** - The programming language our system uses
- **Git** - For downloading the code
- **A code editor** like VS Code (optional but recommended)

*💡 Don't worry if you're new to these tools - we'll guide you through everything!*

## 🚀 Step 1: Getting the Code

First, let's download the banking system to your computer:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dennismbugua/banking-system.git
cd banking-system
```

## 🔧 Step 2: Setting Up Your Environment

Think of this step as preparing your workspace. We need to install all the tools our banking system needs to run:

### Create a Virtual Environment (Recommended)
```bash
python -m venv banking_env
```

### Activate the Environment
**On Windows:**
```bash
banking_env\Scripts\activate
```

**On Mac/Linux:**
```bash
source banking_env/bin/activate
```

## 📦 Step 3: Installing Dependencies

Now we'll install all the required packages listed in our `requirements.txt` file:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### What's Being Installed?
Here's what each major component does:
- **Django 4.2.16** - The main web framework that powers our banking system
- **psycopg2-binary** - Connects our system to PostgreSQL database
- **whitenoise** - Serves static files (CSS, images) efficiently
- **django-crispy-forms** - Makes our forms look beautiful
- **Pillow** - Handles image processing

## 🗄️ Step 4: Database Setup

Our banking system needs a database to store account information and transactions. Let's set it up:

```bash
python manage.py migrate
```

This command creates all the necessary tables in your database, like:
- User accounts
- Transaction history
- Account balances

## 👤 Step 5: Create Your First Admin User

Let's create an admin account so you can manage the banking system:

```bash
python manage.py createsuperuser
```

You'll be prompted to enter:
- Username (e.g., `admin`)
- Email address
- Password (make it secure!)

## 🎬 Step 6: Launch Your Banking System!

The moment you've been waiting for - let's start the server:

```bash
python manage.py runserver
```

Open your web browser and go to: `http://localhost:8000`

## 🏦 Step 7: Exploring Your Banking System

### Demo Account Access
Want to try it out immediately? Use these demo credentials:
- **Username**: `banking@online.com`
- **Password**: `123456`

### What You Can Do:
1. **View Account Dashboard** - See your balance and recent transactions
2. **Make Deposits** - Add money to your account
3. **Process Withdrawals** - Take money out
4. **Generate Reports** - View detailed transaction history
5. **Admin Panel** - Access at `http://localhost:8000/admin/`

*📸 **Screenshots needed**:
- Login page
- Dashboard view
- Deposit/withdrawal forms
- Transaction report
- Admin interface*

## 🎨 Customization Options

### Changing the Appearance
The system uses modern CSS with beautiful animations. Key styling files are located in:
- `templates/core/base.html` - Main layout
- `templates/core/navbar.html` - Navigation styling
- `templates/core/index.html` - Homepage design

### Adding New Features
The modular structure makes it easy to extend:
- **Accounts app** - User management and authentication
- **Transactions app** - Deposit, withdrawal, and reporting
- **Core app** - Shared functionality and templates

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Common Issues

### "Command not found" errors
**Problem**: Python or pip commands don't work  
**Solution**: Make sure Python is installed and added to your system PATH

### Database errors
**Problem**: Migration issues or database connection problems  
**Solution**: 
```bash
python manage.py makemigrations
python manage.py migrate
```

### Port already in use
**Problem**: "Port 8000 is already in use"  
**Solution**: Use a different port:
```bash
python manage.py runserver 8001
```
